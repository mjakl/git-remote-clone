h1. git remote clone

The ability to clone a repository *to* another server is nice to have,
but git doesn't provide it out of the box.

This script allows one to _push_ a local repository to a non-existing
remote one, or in other words, remotely _clone_ a repository.

The repository on the remote side will be a _bare_ repository (not
containing a working directory).

Usage:
git-remote-clone some.server.tld Path/to/projectfolder

The "projectfolder" should not exist and not contain the _.git_ suffix.
